       <p><font size="5">Mahatma Gandhi, byname of <font color="brown"><b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi </b></font>, (born October 2, 1869, 
        Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became 
        the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the
         father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his <i>doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha)</i> to
          <u>achieve political and social progress.</u></p></font>

        <p><font size="5">
            Gandhi’s father was a local government official working under the suzerainty of the British Raj, and his
             mother was a religious devotee who—like the rest of the family—practiced in the Vaishnavist tradition of 
             Hinduism. Gandhi married his wife, Kasturba, when he was 13, and together they had five children. His family
              stayed in India while Gandhi went to London in 1888 to study law and to South Africa in 1893 to practice it.
               He brought them to South Africa in 1897, where Kasturba would assist him in his activism, which she continued 
               to do after the family moved back to India in 1915.</font>
