            Subhas Chandra Bose (known also as Netaji) reflected a more militant and socialist approach to India’s 
            independence movement as compared with Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s less confrontational stance and more
             conservative economics. While in exile in the 1940s, Bose raised a liberation army in East Asia with 
             Japanese aid and influence.</font>
